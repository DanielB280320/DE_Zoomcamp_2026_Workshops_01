    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY',lpep_pickup_datetime) AS PickUpday, 
	       trip_distance AS LongestDistance
	   
    FROM public.ny_green_taxi_trips
    WHERE trip_distance < 100
    AND trip_distance = (SELECT MAX(trip_distance)
                         FROM public.ny_green_taxi_trips
                         WHERE trip_distance < 100

          FROM public.ny_green_taxi_trips T_
          LEFT JOIN public.ny_trip_zones Z
            ON T_."PULocationID" = Z."LocationID"
          WHERE T_.lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2025-11-18' AND '2025-11-19'
